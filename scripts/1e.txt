What is the basic relationship between processes and threads?
A process is an instance of a running program.
It provides the necessary operating environment.
This includes memory and system resources.
A thread, on the other hand, is a unit of execution within a process.
It is responsible for specific task handling.
It can be regarded as the executor of the process.
So, what is the essential difference between a process and a thread?
The essential difference lies in whether they share address space.
Processes typically do not share memory space.  
Each process has its own independent virtual address environment.
Threads, however, share the same process's address space.
This is because they execute in parallel within the same environment.
