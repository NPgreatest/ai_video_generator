Introduction of HTTP/1.1
1.Simple
It consists of only \\header + body
And HTTP/1.1 is stateless
Each request is independent \\and does not rely on \\previous requests
2.Flexible and Extensible
Because various methods \\and fields in the protocol \\can be flexibly expanded
And the content under the \\application layer \\can be freely modified
2.Persistent Connection \\(keep-alive)
HTTP/1.1, based on TCP, \\achieves persistent connections
After sending a message, \\it doesnâ€™t immediately disconnect
Instead, it keeps the connection \\to avoid needing to send \\messages later
3.Pipelined Network \\Transmission
The client can \\send multiple requests \\without waiting for a reply
This can reduce \\the overall response time
However, the server \\must send responses
to these pipelined requests \\in the order they were received
So this can cause \\head-of-line blocking issues
4.Insecure
Because HTTP/1.1 \\does not natively support \\the HTTPS protocol
All content is \\transmitted in plaintext
