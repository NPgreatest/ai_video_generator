What is a deadlock?
A deadlock occurs \\when processes 
wait for others \\resources
which may never \\be released 
unless an external \\action intervenes.
Such as kill the \\process.
In interviews
you might be asked to \\write a deadlock example
Using Python we can \\easily aced it.
Define two threads and \\two locks. 
Each thread grabs one \\lock and attempts to \\grab the other
which leads to deadlock \\because each lock 
is held by the other \\thread. 
Thus, neither \\can proceed.
This scenario is a case of \\circular waiting for
resources that can't be \\released.
Furthurmore, you can \\talk about
These four deadlock \\conditions:
1. Mutual exclusion
2. Hold and wait
3. No preemption
4. Circular wait
