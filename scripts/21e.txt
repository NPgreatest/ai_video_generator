Introduce HTTP 2.0
1. Multiplexing
HTTP/1.1 loads resources \\one after the other
so if one resource \\cannot be loaded
it blocks all the other \\resources behind it
In contrast
HTTP/2 is able to use a \\single TCP connection to send \\multiple streams of data
at once so that no one \\resource blocks any \\other resource
HTTP/2 does this by \\splitting data into \\binary-code 
messages and numbering \\these messages 
so that the client \\knows which stream 
each binary message \\belongs to.
However, that cannot prevent\\ the Head-of-line blocking \\in TCP level.
Thus, the HTTP3 use UDP instead of TCP.
2. Server Push
HTTP/2 can "push" \\content to 
a client before the \\client asks for it.
3. Header compression
HTTP/2 uses the HPACK algorithm for header compression
Headers are stored in a table.
Instead of transmitting \\the full header fields
the protocol allows \\for transmitting just 
an index to a header \\stored in these tables
